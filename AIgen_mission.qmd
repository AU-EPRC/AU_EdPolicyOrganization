### Mission Statement

Auburn University's Center for Education and Health Research aims to advance the understanding of state and federal education and health policies and practices through rigorous empirical research. By leveraging secondary data sources and cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the Center seeks to generate impactful insights and solutions that address the unique challenges of rural education and health systems. Our commitment is to inform policy, practice, and public understanding to foster equitable and effective educational and health outcomes for all communities.

### Main Objectives

1.  **Conduct Rigorous Empirical Research**: Utilize robust research methodologies to analyze state and federal education and health policies, focusing on their impacts and effectiveness.
2.  **Leverage Technology**: Incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence for data scraping, cleaning, management, analysis, and reporting to enhance the scientific process.
3.  **Utilize Secondary Data**: Maximize the use of existing data sources, such as those provided by NCES, while also collecting relevant new data to support comprehensive research.
4.  **Focus on Rural Education and Health**: Address the specific needs and challenges faced by rural communities through targeted research initiatives.
5.  **Inform Policy and Practice**: Provide evidence-based insights to policymakers, educators, and health professionals to inform and improve policy and practice.
6.  **Foster Collaboration**: Build strong researcher/practitioner partnerships with educational institutions, government bodies, research organizations, and community stakeholders.
7.  **Build Rigorous Researchers**: Train researchers and practitioners to use rigorous empirical research methods with an emphasis on reproducible and replicable workflows.
